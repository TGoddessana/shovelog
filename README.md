# Shovelog-Backend

## description

This is a backend project for a simple blog implementation. It is written in FastAPI.

In Korea, when we say "doing something hard", we say "shoveling". The name `shovelog` means "record your shoveling!".

You can create this project from scratch by following the tutorial below.
